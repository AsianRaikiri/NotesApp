# NotesApp

## Getting szarted 
The software used is Android Studio, otherwise there is no other software need for now. 

## Roadmap
After first creatng a notes App that can save notes locally in a database, the app should be expanded to allow the creation of multiple To Do Lists, and later on allow another Path for Expenses, where all expenses can be catalogued for a timespan and afterwards analyzed. 

Backups sshould be made possible by connecting to a server of choice, where all data is send to as JSON format? Or the database file itself is send there.
